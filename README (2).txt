1. The x and y coordinates have been swapped, if changed the tree growth would look similar to James Gains simulation
2. The Reset is once off, can only be used at the start of the program
3. The run line command is 'sample_input.txt' - use make run to run the program
4. A live version of repaint was used called paintComponent()
5. The simulation runs for 1000 years and is set in ShadowGrow.java
6. The sample input file needs to be inserted in the treeGrow folder as it was removed due to uploading speeds
